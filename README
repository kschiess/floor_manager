FLOOR MANAGER - when your job is handling the girls

The floor manager manages a whole graph of objects and lets you create them 
in memory or the database for the duration of a test. 

You need two posts that are linked up to the same author? [1] Easy: 

  FloorManager.define :first do
    one :author do  
      name 'John Smith'
    end
  
    any :post do
      title 'The posts title'
      author.set :author
    end
  end

And in your tests: 
  
  before(:each) do
    FloorManager.reset
    
    floor = FloorManager.get(:floor)
    posts = [floor.create(:post), floor.create(:post)]
  end
  
This gives you two posts to test against. Both posts will have the same
author, right down to the database id. 

COMPATIBILITY

This has only been tested with rails 2. Both Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 should
work.

STATUS

Useful in daily life.
