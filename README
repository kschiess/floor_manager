FLOOR MANAGER - when your job is handling the girls

The floor manager manages a whole graph of objects and lets you create them 
in memory or the database for the duration of a test. 

You need two posts that are linked up to the same author? [1] Easy: 

  FloorManager.define :first do
    one :author do  
      name 'John Smith'
    end
  
    any :post do
      title 'The posts title'
      author.set :author
    end
  end

And in your tests: 
  
  before(:each) do
    FloorManager.reset
    
    floor = FloorManager.get(:floor)
    posts = [floor.create(:post), floor.create(:post)]
  end
  
This gives you two posts to test against. Both posts will have the same
author, right down to the database id.
